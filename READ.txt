Hey! Scratchshark is not done, but you can help. 

How? Comment on my profile that you would like to help towards Scratchshark, and I will consider letting you.

Scratchshark isn't just for copying the project and using it, it's towards using vulnerabilities in the main project to
manipulate Variables, Lists, and Cloud Variables into changing themselves in the original project. For example, if a project
saved their variables in a cloud, you could say, manipulate a cloud variable using Scratchshark to clear all of the data!
Ask anything you want, from clearing data to overloading lists!
